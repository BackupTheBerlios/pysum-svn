Installation Instructions
*************************

----------------
 Debian package
----------------

if you use debian, ubuntu, or some other similar distribution, install pysum
using the .deb package (available on the project page)

1. Download your chosen .deb package via wget or another method

2. From the terminal type sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb (replacing packagename with the name of the package)

 Manual install
----------------

== Depends ==

pysum depends on the Python runtime and associated libraries.

Python (>= 2.5) : http://www.python.org
PyGTK (>= 2.8) : http://www.pygtk.org

== Run Source code (without installing) ==

You can find the source code of pysum in /src. To run (without installing), in
a terminal use the following syntax:

$ cd src
$ python pysum.py

== Install ==

Copy the files in /src to any directory you like, (for example in your home, in
usr/share, etc.)

Note: To work the pysum.glade file must be in the same directory as pysum.py
OR else you have to edit the value of resources_dir specifying the location of
the directory (aprox. lines 22-26 in pysum.py)


--------------
 Translations
--------------

You can find the *.pot file and a spanish translation (es.po files) in the /po
directory. The program use the default directory for translations (usually 
/usr/share/locale/ on a GNU/Linux, but on Solaris it is /usr/lib/locale)

NOTE: In Launchpad ( https://translations.launchpad.net/pysum ) you can find
translations for more languages

You can translate the *.pot or *.po file (using poEdit, KBabel, gtranslator or
launchpad) and next generate a *.mo file. You should copy the *.mo file into
your locate directory (on GNU/Linux: localedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo).
For example, if you use a translation into Spanish, copy the *.mo file to:
/usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo
