$ python pysum.py

Copy the files in /src to the directory where you want (for example in your home,
 in usr/share, etc.)

You can find the *.pot file and a spanish translation (.po files) in the /po

/usr/share/locale/)

You can translate the *.pot or *.po file (using poEdit, KBabel or gtranslator)

file to: /usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo
