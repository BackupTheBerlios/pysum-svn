 Install Translations
----------------------

The program use the default directory for translations (usually 
/usr/share/locale/ on a GNU/Linux, but on Solaris it is /usr/lib/locale)

You can translate the *.pot or *.po file (using poEdit, KBabel, gtranslator or
launchpad) and next generate a *.mo file. You should copy the *.mo file into
your locate directory (on GNU/Linux: localedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo).
For example, if you use a translation into Spanish, copy the *.mo file to:
/usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/pysum.mo
